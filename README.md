# Lab 05

In this lab, you have to create the basic tables and models of the 'Y' program's database, using Migrations and ActiveRecord. Additionally, you should be able to perform simple queries to the database.

## Instructions

### Create Tables

1. Create a migration for the `users` table with the following fields:

- `name` (string)
- `email` (string)
- `password` (string)
- `created_at` (datetime)
- `updated_at` (datetime)

2. Create a migration for the `posts` table with the following fields:

- `title` (string)
- `content` (text)
- `user_id` (integer)
- `published_at` (datetime)
- `answers_count` (integer)
- `likes_count` (integer)
- `created_at` (datetime)
- `updated_at` (datetime)

All this table should have a model associated with them.

### Seed Population

1. Create a `seeds.rb` file in the `db` directory and populate the database with 5 users and 10 posts. All information should be random.
